# 📦 Hyperlocal Delivery Platform Database – Full SQL Server Project
This repository showcases a complete SQL-based backend architecture for a **Hyperlocal Delivery System**, inspired by real-world platforms such as **Zepto**, **Dunzo**, and **Blinkit**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a scalable and normalized database structure
- Insert real-world sample data (users, vendors, products, orders)
- Write powerful SQL queries for business analytics
- Create Views, Indexes, Triggers, and Stored Procedures
- Optimize database performance
- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Automate daily tasks with SQL Server Agent Jobs
- Send scheduled notifications (like Zomato reminders)
